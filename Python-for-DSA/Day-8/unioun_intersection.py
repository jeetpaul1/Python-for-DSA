#Write a program to find the union and intersection of two sets.

# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3} #solution
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Find union and intersection
union_set = set1.union(set2)
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)

# Print results
print("Union of sets:", union_set)
print("Intersection of sets:", intersection_set)
