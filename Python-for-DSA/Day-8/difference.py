#Write a program to find the difference between two sets (elements in one set but not in the other).

# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}  #solution
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Find the difference
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)

# Print result
print("Difference between set1 and set2:", difference_set)
