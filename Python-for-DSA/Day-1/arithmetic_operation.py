#Write a program to calculate the sum, difference, product, and division of two numbers.

a = 10  #solution
b = 5

addition = a + b
subtration = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b

print("Sum:", addition)
print("Difference:", subtration)
print("Product:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
